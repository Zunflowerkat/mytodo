## A short story in Roman Agriculture

You come from a family of agriculturalists who have run a successful farm for as long as you can remember; recently, your family has acquired ample land with a small estate in the hilly northern region of Etruria. Your father has entrusted you with the management of the land, in hopes that **you** can convert it into successful farmland. Your family has loaned you a startup fee and a few necessary farming implements to help you get the relatively small estate up and running. As the estate was previously owned by a peasant farmer, it has come equipped with an extra building to be used as a storage facility, along with a modest family home. You have begun by hiring a few laborers from the surrounding rural towns in preparation for the upcoming planting season. As someone who grew up next to farmers, you know the importance of choosing the right crops for the success of a farming business. You have taken up your father’s advice of growing cereals and grains as it is cheap and easy to grow, however you must decide which variety is the most beneficial for you.

#### You have decided to focus on one crop, choose from:

- *Far* go to *1*
- *Durum* go to *2*
- *Siligo* go to *3*
- *Barley* got to *4*

#### If you have decided to focus on multiple grains go to *5*

1. The decision to plant *Far* (known better in English as Emmer) was a good one. Due to its hulled nature, it is hardy and well protected from diseases and pests. The crops produced a relatively high yield and has sold well due to its popularity. *Far* is commonly used to create *Puls* (a kind of porridge or soup), as well as spelt cakes (these were used as an offering given to agricultural deities such as *Ceres* or *Tellus*) and *mola salsa* (otherwise known as salted flour which was used in every official sacrifice). 

2. Your decision to plant *Durum* has not gone well. You lost a significant portion of your crops during the winter as it is not tolerant to the colder temperatures experienced in Etruria. You have managed to sell what remained of your crops however, you have not profited from this endeavor. 

3.	Due to its resistance to the colder weather, your plantation of *Siligo* has successfully made it through the winter. You do however, experience a small loss due to pests as the free-threshing nature of this wheat variety makes it quite vulnerable. However, due to its popularity in bread making, your harvest has sold well despite some earlier losses. 

4.	Growing *Barley* has proven quite prosperous for you. Although not as popular as the other choices of crop, it has managed to sell well due to its importance as animal feed and ingredient in various remedies. Due to its resistant nature to extreme conditions and pests it has managed to survive the growing season well. It’s modest nature in labor and water input has also made it cheap to produce, making this harvest quite profitable for you. 

5.	This decision has proven quite the challenge for your small estate as you quickly realize how intensive in funds, labor and resources growing multiple grains can be. You have had to make extra expenses in hiring more labor and purchasing further farming equipment to ensure that your crops survive the season. You do loose a bit of the harvest due to the inadequacy of your small storage facility, however all in all, the crops manage to sell well. You neither gain nor lose profit from this endeavor due to your earlier expenses. Perhaps it is better to establish your farm further before attempting this endeavor again.
